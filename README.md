# EduSCAItion
Learn with Sparky üî± the fundamentals of programming üë®‚Äçüíª

## Inspiration
One of the key ways I was finally able to nail down my understanding of CSS Flexbox was with Flexbox Froggy, a simple yet super intuitive and fun game that teaches you the most important concepts in Flexbox. We wanted to make a similar project, expanding upon the concept into other Computer Science disciplines such as programming and machine learning. This, combined with Codesprouts work, led us to our final project: EduScaItion.

## What it does
As of right now, the page contains only one game, inspired by Pok√©mon, which teaches the basics of programming (e.g. variables, data types) while playing a match against another monster, Chizui.

## How we built it
We first decided to inspire ourselves from other platforms, such as Scratch and Codepip, looking for possible patterns and themes in our design. We finally decided on a colorful yet minimalistic tone. We then started working on different parts of Monstercode, our demonstrational game, dividing tasks between the introductory page with the map and chatbot, and the actual game. The project was built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
We wanted to integrate an AI-chatbot that, between lessons, would teach students/learners concepts more in depth (a unique proposition compared to other similar learning platforms). It was our first time working this out, and therefore we had various difficulties in making it work. In addition, since this is our first full web project, we ran into various mishaps born out of our lack of knowledge and practice.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite these challenges and the fact that we may not have had time to integrate all the aspects we would've wanted, we are proud of the overall design and creativity that went into the platform. We wanted to make the process fun as well, which is part of the reason for the inspiration from other games.

## What we learned
We learned a lot of web development basics, which, despite our experience with more advanced frameworks like Next.js, still needed to be fleshed out. We learned how to make transitions and animations, how to better position and layout different UI elements, and how to make these as responsive as possible. In the process, we also learned ways to integrate AI-chatbots into web projects.

## What's next for EduScaItion
Next steps are fleshing out the main game, Codemasters, and then completing the rest of the learning modules.
